### Notes

**Key Accomplishments:**

- Created comprehensive battle ID utilities (8 functions)

- Defined complete TypeScript type system for battle schedule domain
- Created Zod validation schemas with detailed error messages
- Achieved excellent test coverage: 100% for battleId.ts and timezone.ts
- All 249 tests passing across entire common library

**Design Decisions:**

- Reused existing generateBattleId/parseBattleId from date-formatting.ts to
  avoid duplication
- Renamed validation helpers to avoid naming conflicts
- Documented that Official Angry Birds Time is always EST (UTC-5), never EDT
- Separated GMT storage from EST business logic for clarity

**Challenges Resolved:**

- Naming conflicts with existing date-formatting utilities
- Timezone conversion edge cases
- Test timing issues with current time checks
